# peopleflow
Program to detect high density pedestrian flow using distant low-res security cameras.

## Requirements
This script requires Python 3 to run.
There are two dependencies: numpy and OpenCV.

To install numpy:

```pip3 install numpy```

### Installing OpenCV
All tests have been performed with OpenCv 3.2.0 on Debian.
Only some basic functions have been used, so it should work with other versions on other platforms.
Earlier versions of OpenCV might not support Python 3.
There are possibly more guides around the web. Just remember that Python 3 bindings are required.
